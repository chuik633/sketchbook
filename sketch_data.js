                New Yorker Mini Puzzle Advent Calendar! 
                We did a 100 piece puzzle every day of December and tracked our times. 
                I played around with visualizing average times of puzzles and made it a fun race between my family :P
                I experimented with using p5 to create rotating heads, and with using an API so that my family could modify a shared spreadsheet / see live updates.

           For this project, I was interesting in extending my "Hats of the Smithsonian" project by focusing on creating a color driven search. I extended the data to include all fashion related objects from the Smithsonian Open Access Collection as I was also curious about different colors in fabrics, jewelry, shirts, pants, etc. I had a lot of fun experimenting with extracting color swatches and learnning d3.force. I also added an experimental "show gradients" button to create some coded art based on the selected colors!
